**UltraWaveMeter** is an Arduino-based ultrasonic measurement system designed to measure distances and detect waves using the **HC-SR04** ultrasonic sensor. It is built on the **ESP8266** microcontroller and supports real-time data logging, temperature-compensated calculations, and serial interface control.

## About the Project  

This project was developed in collaboration with the [**Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Aveiro**](https://www.ua.pt/pt/decivil/). It was designed as a measurement device to analyze wave behavior in an artificial canal. The collected wave data was used to study the effects of different materials and techniques for **wave energy dissipation**, specifically in structures like breakwaters and seawalls‚Äîsuch as the **Pared√£o de Aveiro**.  

The module was custom-built to be attached to the **artificial canal** used for the experiment. Waves were artificially generated using a mechanical system, allowing researchers to test various **frequencies and amplitudes**.  

Upon completion, the module was delivered to a faculty professor along with an **instruction manual**, ensuring that it could be reused and easily adapted for future experiments.  

A prototype featured Wi-Fi connectivity for remote data transmission and control. However, due to time constraints and network configuration complexities, this feature was omitted from the final version.

## 3D Model and assembly 

The 3D model consists of three main parts. The shell is made up of two sections that screw together, forming a water-resistant enclosure for the electrical components. The ultrasonic sensor is securely held in place at the bottom, fitting snugly within the housing and pressed together with a tray that houses the ESP8266 dev board. The design prioritizes ease of assembly and maintenance, allowing for quick repairs in case of failure.

</figure>

The top and bottom enclosures are screwed together with an insulating material (silicone glue or a rubber gasket) to prevent water ingress, with additional silicone glue applied around the ultrasonic module tubes for further sealing.


### Remote Trigger Button (BTN2)

 - BTN2 uses a JST connector, glued and insulated to prevent water ingression, and a 3-meter cable for remote operation.

## Arduino Code / Sketch

### Deprecated Code
The version of the code in **Original_Portuguese** is now deprecated and is no longer actively maintained. Please use the version in **Translated_English** for the most up-to-date version of the software.

- **[Original Version (Portuguese)](Arduino_Sketch/Original_Portuguese/UltraWaveMeter/UltraWaveMeter.ino)** - Deprecated
- **[Updated Version (English)](Arduino_Sketch/Translated_English/UltraWaveMeter/UltraWaveMeter.ino)** - Recommended

## How the Sensor Works
The **HC-SR04** ultrasonic sensor emits a **40 kHz** sound wave that reflects off objects. The sensor calculates the time taken for the wave to return and determines the distance using the formula:

$$
\text{Distance (cm)} = \frac{\text{Speed of Sound (cm/Œºs)} \times \text{Echo Signal Duration (Œºs)}}{2}
$$  

With temperature compensation:  

$$
\text{Distance} = 0.034 \times \frac{\text{Echo}}{2} \times \frac{1 + T}{273.15} \times 60.368
$$
